The Python script employs the cvzone.HandTrackingModule and OpenCV to create an interactive image presentation system. Utilizing a webcam feed, it tracks hand gestures, allowing users to navigate through a series of images displayed on the screen. 
By detecting gestures such as moving the hand to the left or right, users can seamlessly switch between images.
Moreover, the script features an annotation capability, enabling users to draw on the displayed images using hand movements. 
This functionality enhances interactivity, making the system suitable for applications such as interactive presentations or virtual whiteboards. 
With its intuitive interface and robust gesture recognition, the script offers a versatile solution for engaging visual presentations.
